description: The MCP tools exposed by the Glyphs MCP server.
---

This is the tool surface exposed by the server shipped in this repo (FastMCP `version="1.0.1"`).

Note: the server can be configured with a **tool profile** (in **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…**) that hides tools you don't need for a given workflow. When a profile is active, `tools/list` will return a subset of the full tool surface. For a token-aware explanation and a “which profile should I pick?” guide, see [Settings & tool profiles](../getting-started/start-server.mdx#settings-tool-profiles).

## Most used tools (start here)

- `list_open_fonts`: pick your `font_index` quickly.
- `get_font_masters`: find `master_id` and basic master metadata.
- `review_spacing` / `apply_spacing`: spacing workflow (review → dry run → confirm).
- `generate_kerning_tab`: open a relevance-based worklist proof tab.
- `review_kerning_bumper`: collision/near-miss audit (no mutation).

### Spacing

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `review_spacing` | Review spacing and suggest sidebearings/width (area-based; no mutation). |
| `apply_spacing` | Apply spacing suggestions (supports `dry_run`; requires `confirm=true` to mutate). |
| `set_spacing_params` | Set spacing parameters as font/master custom parameters (no auto-save). |
| `set_spacing_guides` | Add or clear glyph-level guides visualizing the spacing measurement band (no auto-save). |

### Editing

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_glyph` | Add a new glyph to the font. |

| `add_anchor_to_glyph` | Add an anchor to a glyph layer. |
| `set_glyph_paths` | Replace glyph paths from JSON. |
| `apply_collinear_handles_smooth` | Apply `smooth=True` for collinear-handle curve nodes in a single path (supports `dry_run`; requires `confirm=true` to mutate). |

### Docs helpers

| Tool | Description |

|------|-------------|
| `ExportDesignspaceAndUFO` | Export designspace/UFO bundles with structured logs and errors. |
| `execute_code` | Execute arbitrary Python in the Glyphs context. |
| `execute_code_with_context` | Execute Python with injected helper objects. |
| `save_font` | Save the active font (optionally to a new path). |

## Recipes (copy/paste prompts)

### 1) List open fonts + pick `font_index`

```text
List my open fonts.
Call list_open_fonts and tell me which font_index to use next.
```

### 2) Generate a kerning worklist proof tab

```text
Open a kerning worklist proof tab for my current font/master.
Call generate_kerning_tab with {"font_index":0,"rendering":"hybrid","relevant_limit":2000,"missing_limit":800,"audit_limit":200,"per_line":12}
Then summarize what the sections mean and what to kern first (class-first).
```

### 3) Review kerning collisions (no mutation)

```text
Review kerning collisions/near-misses in my current font/master.
Rules: do not mutate anything.

Call review_kerning_bumper with {"font_index":0,"min_gap":5,"relevant_limit":2000,"include_existing":true,"scan_mode":"two_pass","dense_step":10,"bands":8,"result_limit":200}
Then list the 20 worst collisions and what to do next.
```

### 4) Review spacing + dry run apply

```text
Review spacing for my current selection, then propose conservative changes.
Rules: never auto-save; never mutate without a dry run first.

1) Call review_spacing with {"font_index":0}
2) Call apply_spacing with {"font_index":0,"dry_run":true,"clamp":{"maxDeltaLSB":80,"maxDeltaRSB":80,"minLSB":-50,"minRSB":-50}}
3) Wait for me to reply “apply” before calling apply_spacing again with confirm=true.
```

### 5) Review/apply smooth flags for a single path (dry run → confirm)

```text
I want to mark curve nodes as smooth when their adjacent handles are nearly collinear.
Rules: only operate on the one path I specify; do not mutate without a dry run first.

1) Call review_collinear_handles with {"font_index":0,"glyph_name":"A","master_id":"m01","path_index":0,"threshold_deg":3.0,"min_handle_len":5.0}
2) Call apply_collinear_handles_smooth with {"font_index":0,"glyph_name":"A","master_id":"m01","path_index":0,"threshold_deg":3.0,"min_handle_len":5.0,"dry_run":true}
3) Wait for me to reply “apply” before calling apply_collinear_handles_smooth again with confirm=true.
```

### 6) Search bundled docs (`docs_search` → `docs_get`)

```text
Search the bundled Glyphs docs for “GSLayer bounds”.
1) Call docs_search with {"query":"GSLayer bounds"}
2) Pick the best match and call docs_get for that page.
3) Summarize the key parts I need.
```
