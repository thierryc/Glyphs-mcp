title: First session (10 minutes)
description: Install, start the server, connect Codex, and run your first tool call.
---

This tutorial gets you to a **first successful tool call** quickly, so you can trust your setup before diving into kerning/spacing workflows.

## You will accomplish

- Install the Glyphs MCP plug-in
- Connect a client (Codex CLI or Claude Code) to the local MCP server
- Run one tool call (`list_open_fonts`) and interpret the result

## Prerequisites

- macOS + **Glyphs 3**
- Python **3.11–3.13** (the installer blocks Python 3.14+ until tested)

## Step 1 — Install

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 install.py
```

What you should see:
- The installer asks you to pick a Python environment (Glyphs’ Python or an external Python).
- It installs dependencies and places the plug-in in the Glyphs plug-ins folder.

If you hit issues, jump to [Troubleshooting](../getting-started/troubleshooting.mdx).

## Step 2 — Start the server

1. Launch Glyphs
2. Menu: **Edit → Start Glyphs MCP Server**
3. Open **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…** and confirm it’s running

Expected endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/
```

## Step 3 — Connect a client

### Option A: Codex CLI

Add the MCP server:

```bash
codex mcp add glyphs-mcp-server --url http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/
codex mcp list
```

### Option B: Claude Code (VS Code)

If you have Claude Code’s CLI (`claude`) installed, you can add this MCP server in one line:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http glyphs-mcp http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/
```

Then, in Claude Code:

1. Reload VS Code.
2. Run `/mcp` and confirm `glyphs-mcp` is listed.

If you don’t have the `claude` CLI, use the Claude Desktop setup in [Connect a client → Claude Desktop](../getting-started/connect-client.mdx) and enable VS Code MCP discovery (`chat.mcp.discovery.enabled = true`) so Claude Code can pick it up.

## Step 4 — First successful tool call (copy/paste prompt)

In your client (Codex or Claude Code), paste this prompt:

```text
Connect to my Glyphs MCP server and run a quick health check.

1) Call the tool that lists open fonts (list_open_fonts).
2) Tell me:
   - how many fonts are open
   - the familyName/filePath for each
   - which font_index I should use next

If you get any error, quote it verbatim and tell me what to do next.
```

Note: tool name prefixes can vary by client, but in Codex the tool should be discoverable from the connected MCP server.
