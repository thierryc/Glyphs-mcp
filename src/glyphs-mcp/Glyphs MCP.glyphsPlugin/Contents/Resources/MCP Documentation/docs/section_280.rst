.. attribute:: storeSortName
		Set to True in order to manipulate the :attr:`GSGlyph.sortName` and :attr:`GSGlyph.sortNameKeep` of the glyph (see above).
		Makes it possible to ship custom glyph data inside a .glyphs file without a separate GlyphData file. Same as Cmd-Alt-i dialog in UI.

		:type: bool
