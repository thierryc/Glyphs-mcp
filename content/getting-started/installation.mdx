description: Install the Glyphs MCP plug-in in a few minutes.
---

Glyphs MCP ships as a **Glyphs 3 plug-in** plus a small Python server that exposes MCP tools.

## Requirements

- macOS + **Glyphs 3**
- Python **3.11–3.13** (the installer will guide you)

## Recommended: guided installer

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 install.py
```

On macOS, you can also double-click `RunInstall.command` in Finder (it launches the same installer).

:::tip What the installer does
- Detects an appropriate Python
- Installs dependencies in the correct location for Glyphs
- Installs the plug-in into Glyphs’ plug-ins folder (copy or symlink)
- Verifies imports and prints actionable errors if something fails
:::

## Supported Python versions

The interactive installer supports Python **3.11–3.13** and blocks Python **3.14+** until tested.

If you’re not sure what you have installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

## Where things are installed

Typical locations on macOS:

- Plug-in: `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Plugins/`
- Dependencies (common case): `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Scripts/site-packages`

If you choose an external Python in the installer, dependencies may also live in that Python’s **user site-packages** (installed via `pip --user`). The plug-in is designed to add both locations to `sys.path` so imports work reliably.

## Uninstall

1. Quit Glyphs.
2. Remove the plug-in from: `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Plugins/`

Optional (advanced): remove any Glyphs MCP dependencies installed into:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Scripts/site-packages`

:::caution
Be careful when deleting packages from `Scripts/site-packages` — other Glyphs scripts you use might rely on them.
:::

## Verify installation

Open Glyphs and confirm you have:

- **Edit → Start Glyphs MCP Server**
- **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…**

Next: [Start the server](./start-server.mdx).
