.. attribute:: instanceInterpolations
		A dict that contains the interpolation coefficients for each master.
		This is automatically updated if you change interpolationWeight, interpolationWidth, interpolationCustom. It contains FontMaster IDs as keys and coefficients for that master as values.
		Or, you can set it manually if you set manualInterpolation to True. There is no UI for this, so you need to do that with a script.

		:type: dict
