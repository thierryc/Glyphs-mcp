## Quick checks

1. Restart Glyphs (fresh launch).
2. Start the server: **Edit → Start Glyphs MCP Server**
3. Confirm the endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/`
4. Open **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…** and confirm it shows a running state.
5. Check that the port is listening (macOS):

```bash
lsof -iTCP:9680 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Verify the endpoint responds locally:

```bash
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/
```

## No menu items

Expected menu items:
- **Edit → Start Glyphs MCP Server**
- **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…**

Common causes:
- The plug-in wasn’t installed into the Glyphs Plugins folder.
- Glyphs hasn’t been restarted since installing.

Fix:
1. Quit Glyphs.
2. Confirm the plug-in exists in: `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Plugins/`
3. Re-run: `python3 install.py`
4. Re-open Glyphs.

## Can't connect

Start order often matters:

1) launch Glyphs  
2) start the MCP server  
3) then launch/reload your client  

Also confirm you’re connecting to the correct endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/
```

## Python unsupported

The interactive installer supports Python **3.11–3.13** and blocks **3.14+** until tested.

Check your current Python:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you’re on 3.14+, install a supported Python (3.12 is a good default on macOS) and re-run the installer.

## Missing dependencies (ImportError / ModuleNotFoundError)

If the plug-in starts but tools fail to import, dependencies may not be installed where Glyphs can load them.

Common location:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Scripts/site-packages`

Advanced helpers (run from the repo root):
- `src/glyphs-mcp/scripts/install_deps_glyphs_python.sh` (uses Glyphs’ Python)
- `src/glyphs-mcp/scripts/install_deps_external_python.sh` (uses an external Python)

After installing dependencies, restart Glyphs.

## Port in use

If another process is already bound to `127.0.0.1:9680`, the server may fail to start.
Quit the other process or restart Glyphs.

To see what’s listening:

```bash
lsof -iTCP:9680 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

## Problem: Claude/Cursor can’t start `npx`

Some tools spawn MCP servers without inheriting your shell environment. If you use `npx mcp-remote`, ensure:

- Node **20+** is installed
- the client config includes an explicit `env.PATH` pointing to that Node install

## Problem: Browser works but client doesn’t

If you open `http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/` in a browser, you’ll usually see a small discovery JSON response.
MCP clients connect using Streamable HTTP (SSE), so they still need correct MCP configuration.

See: [How Glyphs MCP works](../concepts/how-glyphs-mcp-works.mdx).

## Copy/paste diagnostic prompt

Use this prompt in your AI client when you need help debugging:

```text
Help me debug my Glyphs MCP connection.

1) Try to call list_open_fonts.
2) Tell me which endpoint you used.
3) If you see any error, quote it verbatim.
4) Based on the error, tell me the next 2-3 steps to try.
```
