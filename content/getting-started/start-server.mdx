title: Start the server
description: Start Glyphs MCP inside Glyphs and confirm the local endpoint.
---

## Start the server in Glyphs

1. Launch Glyphs.
2. In the menu bar: **Edit → Start Glyphs MCP Server**
3. Open **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…** to confirm it’s running.

## How to confirm it’s running

In **Glyphs MCP Server Status…**, you should see:
- A “running” state (or similar)
- The endpoint URL you can connect to

## Endpoint

By default the MCP endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9680/mcp/
```

:::note Browser vs MCP client
If you open the endpoint in a browser, it returns a small JSON discovery response.
MCP clients connect using Streamable HTTP (SSE).
:::

## Optional: auto-start

If you enabled auto-start in the status panel, Glyphs will start the MCP server automatically when the app launches.

## Settings & tool profiles (token-aware) {#settings-tool-profiles}

Glyphs MCP settings live in **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…**.

### Where to change settings

Open **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status…**. You’ll typically see:
- **Status** (running / not running)
- **Version**
- **Endpoint**
- **Docs**
- **Profile** (tool profile dropdown)
- **Auto-start server on launch**
- **Copy Endpoint**

### What tool profiles do (and why tokens matter)

Many MCP clients include the server’s tool list (and JSON Schemas) in the model’s prompt context.
Tool profiles don’t change what the plug-in can do — they change what the client *sees* via `tools/list`.

Smaller `tools/list` → fewer tools + smaller schemas → less prompt “footprint” when tokens are scarce.
In long sessions, this can reduce context pressure and improve responsiveness.

### Which profile should I pick?

| Profile | Use when | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Full` | You want everything. | Largest tool/schema footprint. |
| `Core (Read-only)` | You want the smallest footprint and inspection-only workflows. | Does **not** expose `execute_code*` or mutation tools. |
| `Kerning` | You’re doing kerning workflows. | Enables kerning tools (plus core read-only + `execute_code*`). |
| `Spacing` | You’re doing spacing workflows. | Enables spacing tools (plus core read-only + `execute_code*`). |
| `Kerning + Spacing` | You’re switching between kerning and spacing. | Combined workflow profile. |
| `Paths / Outlines` | You’re working with outlines/paths. | Includes path review/apply tools. |
| `Editing` | You’re creating/updating glyphs, components, anchors, metrics. | Includes editing/mutation tools. |

If you want to *prevent* exposing `execute_code` / `execute_code_with_context`, use **Core (Read-only)**.

### How to apply a profile change

1. Pick a profile in **Edit → Glyphs MCP Server Status… → Profile**.
2. Restart the server so the next `tools/list` reflects the profile:
   - Quit and relaunch Glyphs (simplest), then **Edit → Start Glyphs MCP Server**, or
   - restart the server if your setup provides a stop/start workflow.
3. Reconnect/reload your MCP client so it re-fetches the tool definitions.
4. Verify: have your client run `tools/list`, then confirm a tool you expect is present/absent (for example `review_spacing` exists, or `apply_spacing` is absent under **Core (Read-only)**).

### Extra footprint reduction tips

- Prefer `docs_search` + `docs_get` over registering every doc page as its own resource (that’s the default).
- Avoid `docs_enable_page_resources` unless you truly need per-page resources; it can increase what some clients enumerate.

## Optional: security

If you want extra protection (token auth or origin allowlist), see [Safety model](../concepts/safety-model.mdx).
